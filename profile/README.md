## What is NoteBurner?

**NoteBurner** is a professional-grade software suite designed to legally record, download, and convert audio from popular streaming services into high-quality, DRM-free MP3, FLAC, or WAV files. It empowers users to build a permanent, portable music library from their favorite Spotify playlists, Apple Music albums, Amazon Music tracks, and more. Unlike screen recorders, NoteBurner captures the original digital audio stream, preserving 100% of the original lossless quality, along with all metadata like ID3 tags, album art, artist, and genre information.

This makes NoteBurner an indispensable tool for music enthusiasts, audiophiles, and anyone who wants to enjoy their streaming subscriptions offline on any device—be it in the car, on a run with an MP3 player, or on a device that doesn't support the streaming app. The process is incredibly fast, working at up to 10X speed, and maintains perfect output quality, making it the go-to solution for creating personal backups of your most-loved music and podcasts.
